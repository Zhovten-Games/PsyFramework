# ScreeningApp.js

`ScreeningApp` is the main presentation component. It manages application state (selected language, methodology, responses, results), renders the questionnaire, and orchestrates calculations through the `ScreeningCalculator` application service. The component rebuilds the DOM on every state change, wiring translator-driven labels, dynamic badges, action buttons, and results sections that surface category tables and diagnostic label cards. All detail metrics on the label cards now pull copy from the translator (`results.labels.detail.*`) so counts stay localized alongside the rest of the UI. Language choices are generated from `supportedLanguages` so the selector automatically reflects the registry without duplicating configuration.

To respect the hexagonal boundary the component delegates methodology lookups to `MethodologySnapshotBuilder`. The builder projects the active methodology into plain data (localized category names, label names, question descriptors, and per-category guidance maps) so the UI never reaches into core entities directly. Guidance cards still rely on `ConfigMethodology.translateCategoryGuidance` under the hood, but the presentation layer now consumes only snapshot maps which keeps adapters free of domain-aware branching.

When results are available the component now also renders a “guidance” section. It pulls category-specific trigger, fear, and irritant summaries through `ConfigMethodology.translateCategoryGuidance` and displays them as locale-aware cards so clinicians and caregivers see practical aftercare hints alongside raw scores.
