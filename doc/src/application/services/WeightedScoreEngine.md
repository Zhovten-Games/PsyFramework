# WeightedScoreEngine.js

`WeightedScoreEngine` implements the base scoring algorithm used by the screening tool. It iterates over every diagnostic label exposed by the active methodology, tallies "core" and "support" answers with different weights, and applies impact multipliers when high-risk questions are positive. Labels that pass their configured thresholds are returned with lean metadata objects (`id`, `code`, `names`, and computed score breakdowns) so the UI can highlight leading diagnoses and potential comorbidities without leaking raw configuration references. The engine now honours the optional `minimumCoreYes` flag on label criteria (falling back to the number of available core questions) so the minimum positive requirement stays config-driven instead of being hard-coded in the application layer.
